/**
 * Custom Service Transaction extension containing:
 * <p>
 * {@link #userAttributes}: The set of attributes coming from the user IdP (mapped by the SP in front of 
 * this server). This attribute set has to be part of a transaction so that it can be taken up
 * by subsequent /getcert request.
 * <p>
 * {@link #traceRecord}: The key of the trace record entry linked with this transaction. This field is
 * used to link transactions with trace records. Note that a transaction only has a linked trace record 
 * in case a /getcert call.
 * <p>
 * TODO: traceRecord (cnHash) alone does not link to single trace record on its own. You need cnHash+seqnr for this.
 * Or maybe this field is redundant altogether since you can simple derive a cnHash as well as seqnr from the certificate. 
 * <p>
 * {@link #myproxyUsername}: This is an already existing attribute that has been repurposed in this 
 * implementation. It contains the user DN (O+CN) created for a user based on his attributes.
